# GOAP_Basic_Example
A simple Goal Oriented Action Planning example in Python created with and by ChatGPT4 :)

1. **GOAP** provides a way to select a sequence of actions that fulfill a goal, given the current state and available actions.
2. **A*** is the underlying algorithm that finds the path (or plan) with the least "cost" to reach the goal. The heuristic function guides the search towards the goal and is crucial for efficient and desired outcomes.
3. The **heuristic** is just an educated guess on how close we are to the goal. Designing a good heuristic can be both an art and a science, and its effectiveness can vary based on the problem domain.
